# Password Reset Guide

This guide explains how to use the password reset functionality in the Umuhuza platform.

## Overview

The password reset process consists of two steps:
1. Request a password reset
2. Reset your password using the token received via email

## Step 1: Request a Password Reset

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Click on "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter your registered email address
4. Click "Send Reset Link"

You will receive an email with a password reset link if your email is registered in the system.

**Note:** For security reasons, the system will always show a success message, even if the email is not registered.

## Step 2: Reset Your Password

1. Check your email for the password reset link
2. Click the link in the email (or copy and paste it into your browser)
3. Enter your new password
   - Password must be at least 8 characters long
   - Include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters for better security
4. Click "Reset Password"

## Security Features

## Troubleshooting

### I didn't receive the reset email
